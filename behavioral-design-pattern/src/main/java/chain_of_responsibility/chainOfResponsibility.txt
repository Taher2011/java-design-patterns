Chain of Responsibility (CoR) pattern is a behavioral design pattern
that allows a request to be passed
along a chain of handlers, 
where each handler decides either 
to process the request or to forward it to the next handler
in the chain.

This decouples the sender of a request/client
from its potential receivers,
but the exact handler is determined at runtime. 
promoting flexibility and extensibility.

New handlers can be added or removed without modifying existing code.
