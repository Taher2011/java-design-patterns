Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern 
that encapsulates a request as an object, 
decoupling the sender (invoker) 
from the receiver that performs the action. 

The invoker triggers the command’s execution, 
which delegates to the receiver. 

This promotes :
loose coupling-> by decoupling the invoker from the receiver
extensibility-> allows new commands to be added without modifying existing code
reusability-> enhances reusability since command objects can be passed to different invokers.

and supports :
undo
queuing
scheduling

LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand encapsulates
light control(on/off) requests for LightReceiver (e.g., turnOnLights for Bedroom or LivingRoom), 
executed via RemoteInvoker or VoiceInvoker. 

These enable 
undo through a stack-based command history
queuing for batch execution
scheduling via ScheduledExecutorService for delayed actions.
