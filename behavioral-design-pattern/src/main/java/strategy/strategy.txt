The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern
that defines a family of strategies/algorithms, 
each strategy encapsulates specific behavior(algorithm)/functionality and makes them interchangeable.

The client interacts with the StrategyContext object, 
which maintains a reference to the selected strategy 
and delegates calls to the appropriate strategy 
implementation at runtime.

The specific strategy can be selected and swapped dynamically at runtime without changing the client code.

It promotes: 
flexibility : can swaps the strategy at runtime.
extensibility : can add new strategy.
maintainability : each strategy is self-contained and maintains own logic.

It adheres to:
SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)-> Each strategy has a single, well-defined purpose.
OCP (Open/Closed Principle)-> New strategies can be added without modifying existing code.
