The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used when object creation is complex, 
such as when an object has multiple attributes (e.g., more than five), 
some of which are optional or 
require different combinations. 

Instead of overloading constructors with multiple variations 
leads to cluttering the code and reduce readability.

Builder pattern provides a cleaner solution allowing us 
to create objects with specific field states as needed. 

It promotes :
readability, 
maintainability, 
flexibility. 

It supports the creation of immutable objects and 
eliminates the need for constructor overloading.
