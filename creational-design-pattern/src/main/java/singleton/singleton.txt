The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application
and provides a single point of access to it. 

This guarantees consistency, prevents multiple unnecessary object creations, 
and improves memory efficiency. 

It is especially useful in scenarios where object creation/connection is resource-intensive
such as database connections, file systems, or network connections
since these operations consume network bandwidth, memory, and CPU. 

By using the Singleton pattern, we can optimize resource usage 
and avoid creating costly objects/connections on each request.

Singleton via Enum is 100% safe: thread-safe by JVM, serialization-proof, clone-proof, reflection-proof.
serialization (JVM ensures same instance),
cloning (enums cannot be cloned),
reflection (JVM prevents reflective construction of enum types).

Singleton via Bill Pugh is thread-safe because JVM guarantees that 
static inner class initialization is atomic and 
performed only once, 
even in multi-threaded environments.
