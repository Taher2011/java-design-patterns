The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application
and provides a single point of access to it. 

This guarantees consistency, prevents multiple unnecessary object creations, 
and improves memory efficiency. 

It is especially useful in scenarios where object creation/connection is resource-intensive
such as database connections, file systems, or network connections
since these operations consume network bandwidth, memory, and CPU. 

By using the Singleton pattern, we can optimize resource usage 
and avoid creating costly objects/connections on each request.
