The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application
and provides a single point of access to it. 
This guarantees consistency, prevents multiple unnecessary object creations, and improves memory efficiency. 
It is especially useful in scenarios where object creation is resource-intensiveâ€”such as database connections, file systems, or network connections
since these operations consume network bandwidth, memory, and CPU. 
By using the Singleton pattern, we can optimize resource usage and avoid creating costly objects on each request.
